          Why start a community garden?
        </header>
        <p>
          Many families living in the city would like to grow some of their own
          fruits, vegetables, herbs, and flowers. Some want to save money on
          their food bills. Others like the freshness, flavor and wholesomeness
          of homegrown produce. And for many, gardening is a relaxing way to
          exercise and enjoy being out-of-doors. There are also families from
          other cultures who would like to grow traditional foods not available
          in the supermarket

          Community gardens beautify neighborhoods and help bring neighbors
          closer together. They have been proven as tools to reduce neighborhood
          crime--particularly when vacant, blighted lots are targeted for garden
          development. Community gardens provide safe, recreational green space
          in urban areas with little or no park land, and can contribute greatly
          to keeping urban air clean.

          Those who are lucky enough to have sunny backyards or balconies can
          plant a garden whenever they have the time and energy. But what about
          those who do not have a place to garden? For these people, community
          gardens may be the answer.

          There is a lot of work involved in starting a new garden. Make sure
          you have several people who will help you. Over the years, our
          experience indicates that there should be at least ten interested
          families to create and sustain a garden project. Survey the residents
          of your neighborhood to see if they are interested and would
          participate. Hold monthly meetings of the interested group to develop
          and initiate plans, keep people posted on the garden's progress, and
          keep them involved in the process from day one.

          A garden club is a way of formally organizing your new group. It helps
          you make decisions and divide -up the work effectively. It also
          ensures that every one has a vested interest in the garden and can
          contribute to its design, development, and maintenance. It can be
          formed at any time during the process of starting a community garden;
          however, it's wise to do so early on. This way, club members can share
          in the many tasks of establishing the new garden. The typical garden
          club will have many functions, including:
          <ul id="the_list">     
            <li>Establishing garden rules (see sample)</li>
            <li>Accepting and reviewing garden applications</li>
            <li>Making plot assignments</li>
            <li>Collecting garden dues (if any)</li>
            <li>Paying water bills</li>
            <li>Resolving conflicts</li>

            Look around your neighborhood for a vacant lot that gets plenty of sun--at least six to eight hours each day. A
            garden site should be relatively flat (although slight slopes can be terraced). It should be relatively free of large
            pieces of concrete left behind from demolition of structures. Any rubble or debris should be manageable --that is,
            it can be removed by volunteers clearing the lot with trash bags, wheelbarrows, and pick up trucks. Ideally, it
            should have a fence around it with a gate wide enough for a vehicle to enter. It is possible to work with a site that
            is paved with concrete or asphalt by building raised beds that sit on the surface or using containers. You can also
            remove the asphalt or concrete to create areas for gardens, but such a garden will be much more difficult,
            expensive, and time-consuming to start. A site without paving, and soil relatively free of trash and debris is best.

        <p>The potential garden site should be within walking, or no more than a short drive from you and the neighbors who
        have expressed interest in participating. If the lot is not already being used, make sure the community supports
        establishing a garden there.
          <code>^</code>
        </p>
        <p>It's best to select three potential sites in your neighborhood and write down their address and nearest cross streets.
        If you don't know the address of a vacant lot, get the addresses of the properties on both sides of the lot--this will
        give you the ability to make an educated guess on the address of the site. We suggest you identify at least three
        potential sites because one or more might not be available for you to use for various reasons, and you want to end
        up with at least one that works out.
        </p>
        <p>Take the information you have written down about the location of the sites in step 3 to your county's tax assessor's
        office. The Los Angeles County Tax Assessor's office is located at 225 North Hill Street, Room 205. Or go to a
        branch office listed in the white pages of the telephone directory. At this office, you will look through the map
        books to get the names and addresses of the owner of the sites you are interested in.

            Community members should be involved in the planning, design, and set-up of the garden. Before the design
            process begins, you should measure your site and make a simple, to-scale site map. Hold two or three garden
            design meetings at times when interested participants can attend. Make sure that group decisions are recorded in
            official minutes, or that someone takes accurate notes. This ensures that decisions made can be communicated to others, and progress will not be slowed. A great way to generate ideas and visualize the design is to use simple
            drawings or photos cut from garden magazines representing the different garden components--flower beds,
            compost bins, pathways, arbors, etc.--that can be moved around on the map as the group discusses layout.

            While some start-up funds will be needed through determination and hard work, you can obtain donations of
            materials for your project. Community businesses might assist, and provide anything from fencing to lumber to
            plants. The important thing is to ask. Develop a letter that tells merchants about your project and why it's
            important to the community. Attach your "wish list", but be reasonable. Try to personalize this letter for each
            business you approach. Drop it off personally with the store manager, preferably with a couple of cute kids who
            will be gardening in tow! Then, follow-up by phone. Be patient, persistent, and polite. Your efforts will pay-off
            with at least some of the businesses you approach. Be sure to thank these key supporters and recognize them on
            your garden sign, at a garden grand opening, or other special event.
        </p>
            <p>
            Money, which will be needed to purchase items not donated, can be obtained through community fund-raisers
            such as car washes, craft and rummage sales, pancake breakfasts, and bake sales. They can also be obtained by
            writing grants, but be aware grant writing efforts can take six months or longer to yield results, and you must have
            a fiscal sponsor or agent with tax-exempt 501(c)3 status (such as a church or non-profit corporation) that agrees to
            administer the funds.
